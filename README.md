# URBAN INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM

The  problem is a classical *NP-hard problem* in computer science. It has application in facility location and clustering. Basically, the k-center problem models the following real problem that is given a city with facilities, we find the best facilities where to build fire stations. Since firemen must attend any emergency as quickly as possible, the distance from the farthest facility to its nearest fire station has to be as small as possible. In other words, the position of the fire stations must be such that every possible fire is attended as quickly as possible. 

## Problem Definition
Given n cities and distances between every pair of cities, we need to select k cities to place fire stations(or ATMs or Cloud Server) such that the maximum distance of a city to a fire station (or ATM or Cloud Server) is minimized.

## Objectives

The main objectives were :

1. To find the best possible accurate result for maximum inputs.
2. To provide solution to a problem where  maximum distance objects can also access a particular requirement in a minimum length of complexity.
3. To choose k vertices as centers in a weighted undirected graph in which the edge weights obey the triangle inequality so that the maximum distance of any vertex to its nearest center is minimized.
